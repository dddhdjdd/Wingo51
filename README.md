as some informatin about bgmi , they are releasing their 7th anniversry , so they said to players that they will definately make players happy something good news , but the app bgmi did't announced this informatin officially , but because of new upadates players are quitting the game day by day so it is the major reason for qutting the game rapidly , but when we talk about old palyers nastolgia that can be very effective for giving a great comeback for this game ,.
i mean we can say if bgmi do this they will definately gain popularity again that they gained in 2019-20 era , becaus all the old platers will definately connect to the game again , they will remember their old time and love their old emotions 
so finally we can say only this step can be super good  to bgmi,
